# Inventory and Resource Management

Organizations tend to manage their resources using writen notes or excel
spreadsheets. However, this can become tedious and unreliable. This
Resource management app strives to provide a one click method for checkout
and return processes while letting collaborators know of the availability
of each item in realtime.

The app is cross-platform and compatible with modern web browsers.

### CheckOut

Performing a check out is done by clicking tapping the purple button.

### Return

A return is performed by clicking or tapping the orange button.

### Read the Log

A log is kept for each individual item and can be viewed by clicking on
the grey chip that shows either the location of the item or the name of
the person that has checked the item out.
